## Introduction

This Weather API project leverages web scraping to retrieve weather data from a specific website. It uses the Python library BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the website and extract relevant weather information. This data can then be used in various applications, such as weather forecasting or building weather-related features in your projects.

## Installation

Before you can use this Weather API, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Usage

To use this Weather API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd weather-api
```

3. Run the Python script to fetch weather data:

```bash
python weather_api.py
```

This script will fetch weather data from the specified website and display it on the console. You can then use this data as needed for your applications.

## Code in Master Branch

The code for this Weather API project is located in the master branch of the repository. You can find the following files and directories:

- `weather_api.py`: The main Python script that performs web scraping to retrieve weather data.
- `README.md`: This README file that provides information about the project.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
- Other supporting files and directories as needed for the project.

The `weather_api.py` script is where the web scraping and data extraction logic is implemented. You can find and modify the website URL and data parsing logic in this file to customize it for your specific needs.
